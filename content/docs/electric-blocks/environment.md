The next step after creating your location and workspace is to create your environment.

## Whatâ€™s an environment?

An environment is a logical grouping to organize components according to development status (DEV / QA / PROD). It allows having different environments to develop and test the networks before putting them in a productive state.
 
## Creating Environments

To create an environment, click on create on the side bar, fill in the name(choose a name that is short and representative), next select the location and workspace that you are creating the environment for.

When you are done filling that click on the create button. 
Your environment would be created and you can now view it on your environment dashboard.

## Viewing your information on the dashboard
On the dashboard you can view all the environment created.

With the `+` sign you can easily create an environment from the dashboard.
Clicking on each of the environments in your dashboard, shows your Environment Detail.

From the environment detail you can create a network for that particular environment you selected by clicking the `+` icon on Network.
