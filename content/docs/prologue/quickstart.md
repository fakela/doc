To start making full use of the RSK Enterprise cloud you will need to download It from Azure Marketplace, log in with your email and password and activate your account by putting in your token which you get after downloading the RSK Enterprise Cloud.

By Setting up and activating your account, you will be able to create and connect to services later.
